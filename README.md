# mnemonic-to-hex
## Project Purpose
This project provides a Python script designed to convert a 24-word mnemonic phrase into a hexadecimal string, following the BIP39 standard.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

- Python 3.x
- A text editor or IDE of your choice

### Installing

A step-by-step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Bantarus/mnemonic-to-hex.git
   cd mnemonic-to-hex
    ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional)**

   ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # Activate the virtual environment
    # On Windows:
    venv\Scripts\activate
    # On Unix or MacOS:
    source venv/bin/activate
   ```
4. **Preparing to Run the Script**
   
   Before running the script, you need to replace the placeholder "your_24_word_mnemonic_phrase_here" in the script with your actual 24-word mnemonic phrase.
   This phrase will then be converted into a hexadecimal string by the script.


### Running the Script

To run the script, simply execute the following command in your terminal:
```python
python script.py
 ```
